# prettier-css

The project is highly inspired by [`prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

## Usage

Install:

```
yarn add prettier-css 
```

or 

```
npm install prettier-css
```

### CLI

Run prettier-css through the CLI with this script.

```bash
prettier-css [filename ...]
```

(Don't forget the quotes around the globs! The quotes make sure that prettier-css
expands the globs rather than your shell, for cross-platform usage.)
